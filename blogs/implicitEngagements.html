            <h1>Implicit Engagements</h1>
            <p class="author">By Ronnie Alsop | January 25, 2025</p>
            <p class="indent">Recently, Musk complained about X’s recommendations—assuming it wasn’t sarcasm—and it raises an interesting question: How could X’s <b>For You</b> algorithm be better? The platform already leverages real-time machine learning models and graph traversal techniques to surface content tied to a user’s network and interests. But compared to TikTok and Instagram, even if X wields outsized societal influence relative to its user base, why doesn’t it hold users’ attention as long?</p>

            <p class="indent">It’s probably as simple as medium. Sliding a video up delivers a faster dopamine hit than clicking within a tweet. But, say we control for that—what could make X’s recommendations more alluring?</p>

            <p class="indent">TikTok’s algorithm, with its monolithic architecture, thrives on predictive engagement. Every swipe, pause, and rewatch feeds its models, allowing it to surface content eerily tailored to the user’s preferences—even the cringe. It’s not just about what you like—it’s about what holds your attention, even for a fleeting second. Similarly, Instagram Reels taps into its vast ecosystem—pulling data from Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram itself—to craft recommendations that blend personal interests with social validation.</p>

            <p class="indent">X’s graph algorithms, by comparison, effectively tie content to your network but lack the precision of TikTok’s behavioral mapping or Instagram’s ecosystem-level insights. Instead of feeling personal, X’s feed often amplifies the loudest conversations, creating a reactive space dominated by trending opinions and hot takes. It’s less about what you want to see and more about what others are shouting about—a battleground of politics rather than a sanctuary of sensationalistic entertainment.</p>

            <p class="indent">If X wanted to compete with TikTok and Instagram, it could dive deeper into implicit signals—those subtle, almost subconscious moments, like lingering on a thread, revisiting a tweet, or hovering over replies. By capturing and leveraging these behaviors, X could make its recommendations feel less like a chaotic timeline and more like a curated experience.</p>

            <p class="indent">But even with better behavioral mapping, there’s another fundamental challenge: medium. TikTok and Instagram thrive on video because it delivers instant, sensory-driven rewards that text simply can’t replicate. Reels and TikToks keep users scrolling effortlessly, feeding them quick hits of entertainment, while X’s text-first nature demands more cognitive effort. Even if X introduced smoother video integration, would users really flock there for videos when they’re conditioned to go for quips, commentary, and real-time conversations?</p>

            <p class="indent">And maybe that’s where X’s strength lies. It isn’t TikTok or Instagram, and maybe it shouldn’t try to be. Its power lies in discourse, not distraction. It thrives on surfacing real-time conversations, breaking news, and fostering niche communities. The challenge isn’t about creating a more addictive feed but finding the balance between engagement and utility.</p>

            <p class="indent">Should X lean into its chaotic identity, amplifying its ability to stir conversation and influence societal discourse? Or should it try to emulate the addictive polish of its video-first competitors? Perhaps the future of X lies in embracing what it already is: the platform you turn to when you want to think, not just scroll.</p>
            <p class="indent">An intriguing possibility would be if X, with the help of influencers like Mr. Beast, took a step further and acquired TikTok. By integrating their user data across platforms—without fundamentally changing either platform’s experience—X could leverage insights from both to improve its recommendation engine. This could allow for more personalized suggestions, not just based on behavior within X, but drawing from users’ TikTok interactions too. It wouldn't require massive changes to the platforms themselves but would aim to enhance the overall user experience by using shared behavioral data to fine-tune what content rises to the surface. If executed thoughtfully, this could make the "For You" algorithm on X far more compelling, while still respecting the distinct identities of both platforms.</p>

            <p class="indent">If X can integrate implicit signals and refine its user experience—while staying true to its identity—it could carve out more of a niche that doesn’t compete directly with TikTok or Instagram but instead offers something distinctly its own. Maybe X doesn’t need to amplify engagement at all—it just needs to serve the public.</p>
